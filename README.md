# Scripts
This repository includes all bash scripts that I did using Kali Linux. I will explain each of them in this readme file.
As all of the files are bash scripts except this readme file I will tell you to run a bash scipt in Linux. If you already know then you can skip these steps.
1st Open the terminal in the folder that you downloaded the bash script. 
2nd write ./{Name of the bash scipt}. Example: ./Macadressorgulama.sh will execute Macadressorgulama.sh
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macadressorgulama.sh is a bash script that expect you to write a mac adress which you want to learn its vendor. You must write the mac adress format like this: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX . It will make a query to https://macvendors.com/ . If you have a internet connection then it will show the vendor of that mac adress.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learn_the_mac_from_a_nmap_file.sh is a improved version of Macadressorgulama.sh. If you want to use this script you must have "nmap" (https://nmap.org/). You need to output file with -oN. -oG , -oX , -oS will not work. If there are multiple mac adresses you can choose which one do you want to learn.

I hope I explained well (This is my first github repository). If there is a error or something that you want to tell contact me on cemtursun84@gmail.com Goodbye :)
